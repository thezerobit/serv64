# serv64

A simple BBS-like telnet server that supports XMODEM downloads.

## Implementation Notes

How to write a functional stateful server?

When some bytes are received, call an update function that takes
the current state and the bytes received and a timestamp and
returns some data that represents a series of stateful actions
including sending data back and changing the state of the server.
The top-level interpreter executes stateful changes based on these
actions, but the stateless, functional servers can be unit tested with
ease.

## Usage

To start a server on port 8080:

    lein run
    
Telnet to this port to test it out:

    telnet localhost 8080
