# serv64

A simple BBS-like telnet server.

## Implementation Notes

How to write a functional stateful server?

When a byte is received, call an update function that takes
the current state and the byte received and a timestamp and
returns some data that instructs the program
whether to do nothing (:ignore), update the state (:update),
or disconnect (:disconnect) and also whether to send any
data back to the client or not. This update function is purely
functional and therefore easy to fully test with unit tests.

## Usage

To start a server on port 8080:

    lein run
    
Telnet to this port to test it out:

    telnet localhost 8080
